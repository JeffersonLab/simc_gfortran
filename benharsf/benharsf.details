Subject: Spectral Functions


Hallo John, 

sorry for being somewhat late in getting back to you with the promised sftuff.
Attached to this message are five files, containing the spectral functions
of Carbon, Iron, Gold, Nuclear matter and 4He.

As for 3He, we never did a calculation of the full spectral function. To 
obtain inclusive cross sections and EMC ratios I have been using the 
spectral function of the Hannover group. However, I also have a 3He spectral function 
obtained using the approximation scheme developed for 4He. Just let me know
which one you want.

The relevant references are

Below is a short explanantion of the way the files are arranged.

That's all for now

Best

*************************************************************************************

The files are organized as follows

 *** Gold: file 'pke197_tot.data' ***

- P(k,E) is given on a 40*80 grid. The binsizes are 20 MeV/c for K and 5 MeV
  for E. The E-range starts at E_min = 0. The p-range starts at p_min = 0.

- there are 40 bloks (one for each value of k), each of them containing 21 lines.

- the first line of each block gives the value of k in MeV/c. Then follow 20
  lines containing four pairs of (E,P(k,E)) values each.

- the spectral function is normalized to Z=79.  

 *** Iron: file 'pke56_tot.data' ***

- P(k,E) is given on a 40*80 grid. The binsizes are 20 MeV/c for K and 5 MeV
  for E. The E-range starts at E_min = 2.5 MeV. The p-range starts at p_min = 0.

- there are 40 bloks (one for each value of k), each of them containing 21 lines.

- the first line of each block gives the value of k in MeV/c. Then follow 20
  lines containing four pairs of (E,P(k,E)) values each.

- the spectral function is normalized to Z=26.    

 *** Carbon: file 'pke12_tot.data' ***

- P(k,E) is given on a 40*80 grid. The binsizes are 20 MeV/c for K and 5 MeV
  for E. The E-range starts at E_min = 0. The p-range starts at p_min = 0.

- there are 40 bloks (one for each value of k), each of them containing 21 lines.

- the first line of each block gives the value of k in MeV/c. Then follow 20
  lines containing four pairs of (E,P(k,E)) values each.

- the spectral function is normalized to Z=6.         

 *** Nuclear matter: file 'ompkeb4.dat' ***

The spectral function P(k,E) (in units of fm^3*MeV^-1) is tabulated
as a function of k (in units of fm) and E (in units of MeV).
The k grid consists of 24 points, 13 at k less than the Fermi momentum k_F
(for symmetric nuclear matter at equilibrium density k_F = 1.33 fm^-1)
(steplength .1 fm) and 11 at k>k_F (steplength .266 fm). For any value
of k the table gives the spectral function integrated over a missing energy
bin, whose central value is also tabulated.    

The file is organzed as follows:

 - the first line contains the step lengths and the number of steps for the
    k grid (.1 .266 13 11 24).

 - then come 24 similar bloks, one for each value of k. The first line in each
   block gives the value of k, the width of the bin in E and the number of
   bins. The following lines contain the central energies of the bins and the
   integrals of the spectral function over the energy bins.     

For example, the first two entries in the fourth line of the file say that
at k=.1 fm^-1 the spectral function integrated over the energy range 32-36 MeV
is .618e-3 fm^3*MeV^-1.

The overall normalization is such that:

    (3/k_F^3) \int dE dk k^2*P(k,E) = 1         

 *** 4 Helium: file 'spec4he.dat'

 - the first line gives the number of momentum and energy bins (50 and 35, respectively)

 - the central values of momentum bins are given in lines 2-51

 - lines 52-86 give central values and size of the energy bins

 - then follows 35 blocks of 13 lines each, giving the spectral function as a function 
   of momentum for each energy. For example, line 87 gives the spectral function for the 
   first energy bin nad the first four momentum bins.

 - the normalization is 

    4 \pi \int dE dk k^2*P(k,E) = 1
