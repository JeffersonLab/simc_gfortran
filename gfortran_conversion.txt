Notes on conversion to gfortran (fortran 90)

Mainly - replacing structure with types.

0. Generic, easy stuff: cannot have Vax tab format for line conitnuation.


1. Generically,

       structure /Cartesian/
                real*8          x,y,z
        end structure

    becomes

       type Cartesian
                sequence
                real*8          x,y,z
        end type

2.  instead of recon.e.x for example, references using recon%e%x

3. "sequence" is required if your vairable is used in common block. For now -
just put in every type.

4. Cannot simulatenously decalre and define:


        structure /double_arm/
                structure /arm/ e
                  real*8                delta, yptar, xptar, z
                end structure
                structure /arm2/ p
                  real*8                delta, yptar, xptar, z
                end structure
        end structure

becomes


        type arm
                sequence
                real*8          delta, yptar, xptar, z
        end type                

        type arm2
                sequence
                real*8          delta, yptar, xptar, z
        end type                


        type double_arm
                sequence
                type(arm)::e
                type(arm2)::p
        end type


5. types cannot have same name as variable.
