Subject: HMS-100 MC optics files

The HMS optics files are:

hms100-monte.fox    Calculates forward and reconstruction coefficients
                    for use in my MC. Note that the format has changed
                    (there is a more descriptive header before each set)
                    and also the aperture positions may be different from
                    what SIMC expects.

forward_cosy_hms100.dat
                    Forward coefficients calculated by hms100-monte.fox
                    These are the standard forward transformations I use.

recon_cosycalc_hms100.dat
                    Recon coefficients calculated by hms100-monte.fox
                    Reconstruction with these has divergent behavior
                    away from the origin, but still within the nominal
                    acceptance. I only use these as input for refitting.

hms100-monte-v1.fox Calculates forward and reconstruction coefficients.
                    Very similar to hms100-monte.fox, except that the
                    user isn't asked any questions, and the apertures are
                    located at the "standard" (acording to my understanding)
                    positions. But you better check against SIMC to make sure.
                    Also, I think the output format is more compatible with
                    what SIMC expects. The recon coeff is calculates are
                    identical to those from hms100-monte.fox

recon_refit_hms100.dat
                    These are recon coefficients produced by refitting
                    forward-propagated MC events. Only coefficients that
                    were non-zero in the COSY calculation are allowed to
                    vary. The input phase space was defined by:
                       delta = +/- 10%
                       yptar = +/- .080
                       xptar = +/- .100
                       xbeam = +/- 0.25 cm (flat density)
                       tgt length = 5.0 cm
                       spectrometer at 90 degrees
                       pion collimator
                       magnet and beampipe apertures
                    Some of these limits were tuned by trial and error.
                    I found that if I made them too big, then other
                    distortions crept in. These are my standard recon
                    coefficients for monte-carlo work.

hms100-monte-decay.fox
                    Calculates "sectioned" forward transformation coeff's
                    for the magnets only. These are used by my MC to
                    implement decay-in-flight. The transformations are now
                    also explicitly a polynomial in "Z", a curvilinear
                    coordinate describing the axial position in the magnet.
                    Because of technical difficulties arising from effective
                    magnet lengths for the quads that are both larger and
                    smaller than the nominal lengths, I ended up moving the
                    apertures to the ends of the magnetic lengths, instead
                    of the nominal lengths. For consistency, the aperture
                    positions used with the non-sectioned (ordinary) coeff's
                    were moved to the same places.
