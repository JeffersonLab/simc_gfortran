      subroutine pion_coll_absorb(ppi,thick,transmission)
c Subroutine to calculate probability that pion will be absorbed in the SOS
c collimator - can be used for HMS assuming same geometry applies. TH - checked that.

C DJG For now, I use the "reaction" cross sections. Also, only implemented for
C DJG pi+ - no pi-.

! TH - cross section from Dave's parameterization of the energy and A dependence up to
! TH   pion momenta of ~ 2 GeV, we extended that to > 2 GeV during Fpi analysis 

      implicit none
