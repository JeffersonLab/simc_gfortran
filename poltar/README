This directory contains notes and code for implementing the UVa polarized
target in SIMC. This was originally done by Glen Warren - I have put
his coding changes, which were done with an older version of simc and
for use with the HMS only in the gaw_code directory.  The files contained here.

gaw_code              - subroutines and include files Glen Warren modified 
     			for original implementation of polarized target in simc
tgt_field_changes.txt - Glen's list of coding changes
tgt_field.txt         - Glen's description of the general scheme for target
			field implementation
daveg_tgt_field_changes.txt - My list of detailed changes to simc_semi for
			      THIS version of simc_poltar
tgt_field_map.dat     - the polarized target field-map
trg_track.f  	      - Glen's original subroutine that handled tracking
			through the polarized target field. This has been
			slightly modified for this version of simc
