Below is a description of changes necessary to include the code for
the target field optics for the Gen E93-026 experiment.

structures.inc and structures_init.inc
  added rasterx to event_target structure

simulate.inc and simulate_init.inc
  extended debug to 6 element array
  declared tgt_field_file,using_tgt_field,drift_to_ndet
  put these three variables in the grnl common block

target.inc
  added Bangle (angle of magnetic field)

dbase.f
  convert targ.Bangle to radians
  print comment about using target field
  register debug as a 6 element array
  register targ.Bangle, using_tgt_field, tgt_field_file, drift_to_ndet

event.f
  load value for main.target.rasterx

mc_hms.f
  added frx to passed variables in declaration
  included simulate.inc instead of constants.inc
  declared frx,ctheta,stheta
  added call to target field mapping routine
  print coords when (debug(6)=.true)

results_write.f
  changed ntu(12) and ntu(24) to something that is a better analogy 
     target variable.  Feel free to not use this.  I left it in so 
     that one could see the connection to other parts in the code.

simc.f
  initialize target fields for both arms
  output values of tgt_field_file and using_tgt_field in *.hist file
  declare frx
  fill frx
  fill in_P_arm.z to be generated y component at z=0.  See note 
     in results_write.f
  added frx to variables passes in call to mc_hms
  added call to routine that transports protons through a magnetic field
  fill in_E_arm.z to be generated y component at z=0.  See note 
     in results_write.f
  added code to transport electron from target to hms in target field
  print coordinates (only does this when debug(6)=.true.)
  more debug(6) stuff

trg_track.f
  contains the new code for the target field tracking

Makefile
  defined simcdir and Csoft for my system. 
  added trg_track.o to OBJ2.  
  commented out the definition of CERN_ROOT
